'A': asymmetry
'Ax','Ay': asymmetry center
'C': concentration index
'G': gini coefficient
'G2': gini coefficient measured by using a SB mask (do not trust)
'G_c': gini coefficient measured using CIRCULAR aperture
'M20': M20
'Mlevel1': minimum pixel value defining brightest 20% of pixels
'Mx', 'My': M20 center
'Rp': Petrosian radius (elliptical aperture -- correct this time!)
'r20',
'r50', 
'r80', 
'Rp_SB': surface brightness as 1 Rp
'Rpflag': >0 indicates error in Rp measurement
'a': SExtractor semi major axis
'b': Sextractor semi minor axis
'theta': SExtractor position angle of ellipse
'e': SExtractor ellongation
'elipt':SExtractor ellipticity
'kron': SExtractor kron radius
'name': name of image datacube, of form "f_[SDSSid]_4Rp.fits"
'objid': SDSS object ID
'outdir': directory for all output files
'dec', 'ra': SExtractor coordinates 
'med': Median of background pixels as determined by SExtractor segmaps
'rms': RMS of background pixels as determined by SExtractor segmaps 
'stn': standard dev of background pixels as determined by SExtractor segmaps
'x','y': SDSS galaxy center
'xc', 'yc': rounded galaxy center
'Rp_corr': same as Rp (this is so that when matched with other catalogs it has a distinct column name for comparison with the uncorrected measurements)
'C_corr': same as C
'A_corr': same as A
'G_corr': same as G
'M20_corr': same as M20
'cat': "cleaning" category -- description in `clean.py`; not used for anything
'oflag': cleaning flag indicating image was over cleaned
'bflag': cleaning flag indicating... i forgot 
'uflag': cleaning flag indicating under cleaning -- None of the cleaning flags are very good
'SE_diff': difference between SDSS galaxy center and SExtractor's center
'A_diff': difference between SDSS galaxy center and asymmetry center
'M_diff': difference between SDSS galaxy center and M20 center
