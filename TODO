code up a script that plots all kinds of histograms
    -- I don't want to have to type the same shit over and over again

code up a script that plots regular plotty things

code up a script that makes image figures and makes them pretty

-----code up M20, damnit!

revamp Galaxy -- we need to be better at calling classes within this class 
                 the elliptical aperture class - we should only have to call 
                 this one time! not in every function - that wastes time
    Should each parameter be a class?!! .... that could be cool
        Concentration -- r80, r20, Cvalue
        Asymmetry -- Acenter, 
        Gini -- 
        M20 -- 
                 
                 
1. Fix Mtot minimization -- create a grid to minimize over instead of 
    "following the gradient"
2. Fix plotting -- how does python plot? [x,y] or [y,x]? 
3. Make asymmetry figures better -- black/white -- compare Asym center to Mtot center
4. Try minimizing by computing Asym or Mtot over a predefined grid instead!
5. For Gini and M20 -- try selecting galaxy pixels that have a minimum SB of that 
    at 1 Petro instead of just all pixels within 1 Petro
6. FIX THE CLEANING ALGORITHM
    a. pull up seg maps of the worst offenders
    b. figure out how to make it better!
    c. put in a flag -- after cleaning, run SExtractor in faint mode AGAIN; 
        if nothing is detected near the center -- flag that bitch!        


        
MUSE observations -- proposal to follow up on clumpy SDSS red galaxies

z = 0.8: 0.75 kpc/res el
z = 0.01: 0.2 kpc

z = 0.03  ==> 0.75 kpc 
redshit cut at z = 0.04
